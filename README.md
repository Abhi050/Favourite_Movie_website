# Favourite_Movie_website
In this project i choose my favourite movies or shows and made a website in which their image is displayed(similar to netflix) and on clicking them it play their youtube trailer.
The project consist of three files:
1.entertainment.py(file which contain your list fo favourite movies/shows and their various data)
2.fresh_tomatoes.py(file which contains the code of the websites)
3.media.py(file that connects all the three files together)

Step 1:
For your own favourite movies/shows , change the data in entertainment.py file.
You have to change the name of the movie/show, path of their image(taken from wikiperdia,etc. and try to shorten their urls for errorfree rexecution), their short description according to you , their release data and path of their Youtube Trailer.

Step 2:
run the file entertainment.py on python 2.7.x

Enjoy!!!!
This is my second open sourced project.
Open to all suggestions regarding readme file, code or coding style.

THE PROJECT IS INSPIRED FROM  one of the UDACITY PROGRAM which I am not the part of but decided to made this project myself.
